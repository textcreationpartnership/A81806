            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And therefore we know no reaſon why your Lordſhips may not give an Anſwer to thoſe obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in writing. For as it is not agreeable to the uſage of Parliaments, for the two Houſes to give His Majeſty reaſons why He ſhould paſſe any Bill preſented by them; ſo it is no more agreeable to the ſame uſage, for His Majeſty to give reaſons why he doth not paſſe Bills ſo preſented. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Lordſhips to conſider, that we are now in a Treaty, and we conceive the proper buſineſſe thereof, to be, for your Lordſhips to give us Reaſons, why His Majeſty ſhould conſent to the Propoſitions made by you, or for us to give Reaſons to your Lordſhips, why we cannot conſent to thoſe Propoſitions; otherwiſe it would be only a Demand on your Lordſhips part, and no Argument of Treaty between us. And we muſt profeſſe to your Lordſhips, that (as we conceived in our former pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) the Succeſſion of Epiſcopacy, by Succeſſion from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, was conſented to on all parts, ſo we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the contrary thereof, was ſo much as alleadged, much leſſe that the unlawfulneſſe thereof was proved, the Queſtion of the lawfulneſſe thereof having never yet come in debate. And we ſhall be very ready to receive any aſſertion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:158468:29"/> from your Lordſhips to that purpoſe, not doubting but we ſhall give your Lordſhips full ſatisfaction in that poynt. And we conceive the Alterations propoſed to us by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, to be a very proper Anſwer to your Lordſhips Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and moſt agreeable to the end, for which thoſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeem to be made. And that ſince it appears, that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy in the manner propoſed, is viſibly inconvenient, and may be miſchievous, the Regulating of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, being moſt conſonant to the Primitive Inſtitution, will produce all theſe good effects towards Peace and unity; which Regulated Epiſcopacy, is the ſumme of our former pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we deſire your Lordſhips to conſent to the ſame, And we againe offer to your Lordſhips, that if you ſhall inſiſt upon any other things neceſſary for Reformation, we will apply our ſelves to the conſideration thereof.</p>

And we conceive our Demands concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> to be moſt reaſonable, and all objections made againſt them to be by us removed; And why your Lordſhips ſhould inſiſt that the Commiſſioners ſhould not be nominated by the two Houſes onely, and His Majeſty, who is to be equally ſecured, ſhould name none, we much marvaile at, when you may well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this power was not to be exerciſed by the Commiſſioners, untill a Peace had been concluded upon this Treaty, and then His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had been fully ſecured by the Lawes of the Kingdome, and by the duties and affections of His Subjects, neither could the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners doe any thing in violation of the Peace, to the prejudice of His Majeſty, contrary to the Truſt repoſed in them, they having a rule preſcribed which they were not to tranſgreſſe, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable by both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> respectively, and being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any miſcarriage to ſevere puniſhment. And as for their ſecurity who have been with His Majeſty in this Warre, an Act of Oblivion is deſired to be paſſed, whereby all His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in both Kingdomes would have been put in one and the ſame condition, and under the ſame protection, with ſome exceptions mentioned in thoſe Propoſitions; And if the Commiſſioners had been ſeverally choſen, the memory of theſe unnaturall Diviſions muſt needs have been continued, and probably being ſeverally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, would have acted dividedly according to ſeverall intereſts, and the Warre thereby might be more eaſily revived: whereas the ſcope of the Propoſitions we have tendered, was to take away occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of future differences, to prevent the raiſing of Armes, and to ſettle a firme and durable Peace. And to your Lordſhips objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Commiſſioners were to continue without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, although the reaſonableneſſe thereof hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſted to your Lordſhips, yet out of moſt earneſt deſires of Peace, we have propoſed to your Lordſhips a time of ſeven yeares, as is expreſſed in our Paper delivered to your Lordſhips the <hi>21<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Neither doe we know that any Argument was uſed by your Lordſhips from the proceedings in Parliament; And if you ſhall give any, we ſhall be ready to Anſwer it: And we conceive, that the advice given to His Majeſty, from the Lords Iuſtices and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Teſtimony of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, expreſſing the miſerable condition of that Kingdome, and inability to beare the Warre, ſhould appeare to your Lordſhips to be juſt grounds, for His Majeſties aſſenting to the Ceſſation. One of the Letters delivered by us to your Lordſhips, bearing date the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1643. was ſent by the Lords Iuſtices and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Secretary <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> in which was incloſed their Letter to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, of which your Lordſhips have likewiſe an Extract, and a Remonſtrance of the Officers of the Army to the

And that it was not unfit for His Maieſty to agree to that Ceſſation, nor deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion, nor for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Popiſh Rebells: but much for the advantage of the Proteſtant Subjects there, who were in apparent hazard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by Force and Famine, occaſioned by the want of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which had been promiſed to them, as we have formerly ſaid. And we ſhall give yout Lordſhips a further Anſwer to your other Propoſitions concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the time comes againe for that Debate.</p>

And when that both Houſes of Parliament were deſirous further to ſupply thoſe Wants, and for that purpoſe did tender a Bill to His Majeſty, It was refuſed.

For the extracts and Copies of the Letters delivered by us to your Lordſhips, from the Lords Iuſtices and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, We have been, and are willing that your Lordſhips ſhould compare them with the Originalls; But for your having the names of the Perſons who writ the ſame (ſince

                     <p>WE doe conceive, that the Arguments uſed by us, might <note place="margin">CXLIX.</note> have fully ſatisfied your Lordſhips, againſt His Majesties power to make a Ceſſation with the Rebells in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered whatſoever your Lordſhips have hitherto alleadged to the contrary; and Offered, if any other doubts yet remaine, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to cleare them, which ſtill we are ready to doe; And we have heard nothing juſt, or reaſonable for that Ceſſation. It will be made evident, that the neceſſities, which by your Lordſhips were made excuſes for the Ceſſation, were created on purpoſe to colour the ſame, and we are compelled by your Lordſhips paper, to let you know, that the Committees of Parliament, ſent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to endeavour to ſupply their neceſſities, were diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the principall inſtruments for that Ceſſation, and when they had taken up <hi>2000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>
                        </hi> upon their perſonall ſecurity for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, they were preſently after commanded from the Councell, by a Letter brought thither from His Majeſty, by the Lord <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Secretary; And when the Officers of the Army were contented to ſubſcribe for Land, in ſatisfaction of their Arreares, it was declared from His Majeſty, that He diſapproved of ſuch ſubſcriptions, whereby that courſe was diverted. And we doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that what ever ſummes of money raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> were made uſe of by both Houſes of Parliament, were fully ſatisfied with advantage, and as we are informed, before the Bill mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our former paper was refuſed by His Majeſty; And for the Regiments of Horſe and Foot mentioned by your Lordſhips, to be

                        </hi> and imployed otherwiſe by the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: It is true that Forces were ſo deſigned, and when the Money, Armes and other Proviſions were all ready, and nothing wanting but a Commiſſion from His Majeſty for the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> who was to Command them, the ſame could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which was the cauſe thoſe Forces did not goe thither, and when twelve Shipps, and ſix Pinnaces were prepared with 1000, or more land Forces, for the ſervice of, <hi>Ireland,</hi> and nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired but a Commiſſion from His Majeſty, the Shipps lying ready and ſtaying for the ſame, were three weeks together at <hi>300<hi rend="sup">l</hi>
                        </hi> a day charge, yet the ſame was denyed, though often deſired. And where your Lordſhips ſeem to imply, that the proviſions ſeized by His Maieſties Forces, were going for <hi>Coventrey,</hi> it was made known to His Maieſty, that the ſame were for <hi>Ireland.</hi> And your Lordſhips muſt needs conceive (that the papers you delivered to us, being but Extracts, and for that you deny us, ſo to compare them with the Originalls, as to have the names of the Perſons, by whom they were Written) it is altogether unreaſonable for us to give any credit to them, it being manifeſt by this, and our former papers and debates, that the Ceſſation with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> is both unjuſt and unlawfull: We therefore inſiſt on our demands concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> as apparently good for His Maieſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there, and for reducing that Kingdom to His Maieſties Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                     <p>For the diverſion of the moneys raiſed for that Warre, if they had been ſince repayed, (the contrary whereof is credibly informed to His Majeſty,) yet that preſent diverſion might be, and we beleeve was a great meanes of the future wants of that Kingdome which indueed the Ceſſation. As to the Lord <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Commiſſion we conceive we have already fully ſatisfied your Lordſhips the juſt reaſons thereof.</p>
                     <p>For the Letters, whereof your Lordſhips had Copies, we conceive that you being thereby ſatisfied of the Contents, and that they came from the Lord Iuſtices and Councell there, your Lordſhips need not doubt of the truth of the matter; And for the names of the ſingle perſons ſubſcribing; we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is deſired for any other purpoſe, then to be made uſe of againſt ſuch of them as ſhould come into your Quarters, you having not granted, though deſired, that it ſhall not turn to their prejudice, if we ſhould give in their Names.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:158468:71"/> the continuance of the miſeries in the two, muſt render thoſe in the third remediloſſe, if it be not preſerved by ſome other meanes, then the proſecution of the Warre; neither can it be foreſeen or determined, what help or Aſſiſtance either party may make uſe of, where it findes it ſelfe oppreſſed, and over-powred by the other, eſpecially when it calls in any help, and leaves no meanes unattempted to deſtroy the other.

Notwithſtanding by the care of hoth Houſes of Parliament here for their ſupply, they were able to ſubſiſt, and did ſubſiſt at the time of that Ceſſation, although the making thereof reduced them to farre greater neceſſities, then otherwiſe they could have ſuffered, beſides the notorious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby to the Rebels, when their wants and extremities were moſt preſſing. And we ſhould not againe have troubled your Lordſhips with theſe anſwers, had they not been cauſed by your own repetition of the Letters, of part whereof you have given us Copies, though not the knowledge of the Perſons from whom they came, only you were pleaſed to mention, the Lords Iuſtices, and Councell there, yet we are aſſured, even by ſome who were of the Councell at that time when the Letters were written, that the ſame was done only to preſſe for ſupplies from hence, without the least intention in them, of inducing a Ceſſation, neither doe the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:158468:72"/> Copies containe any thing tending to a Ceſsation, or the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; And we have cauſe to grieve, not onely at what your Lordſhips expreſse concerning the complaints from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their great extremities, but that the ſame being procured and increaſed by the Popiſh Party, yet we ſhould find ſuch earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to lay the blame and neglect therein upon the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament here, who have been ſo zealous for their reliefe, and whoſe onely care (under the bleſſing of God) hath been their preſervation, and that in the heat of our owne miſerable Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have continued their Supplies, and from our owne great wants, have not ſpared to afford our Brethren there the meanes of their ſubſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Proteſtants in <hi>Munſter, Connaught,</hi> and <hi>Viſter,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Ceſſation, were many of them <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and both they and the <hi>Scots</hi> ſuffering under as great wants and failer of Supplies, as the Proteſtants in other places, and in no better poſture of their owne defence; Notwithſtanding in a true ſenſe of their owne duty and Conſcience, they have oppoſed and ſtill doe oppoſe the ſame, neither were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there neglected, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips have been miſinformed, by ſuch who labour to destroy both Nations, and as a meanes thereto to divide them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the goods ſeized neare <hi>Coventry,</hi> we have mentioned other particulars aſſerted to be ſeized, not without His Majeſties owne knowledge and direction, as we are informed, and are moſt unwilling to beleeve; Neither doe we underſtand it to be an excuſe for feizing ſome goods, to ſay that His Majeſty did forbeare to ſeize others in his Power, but when His Maieſty ſhall rightly ponder the horridneſſe of that Rebellion, we hope thoſe wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments who contrived, and doe ſupport the ſame, will have no power to alter His Maieſties tender ſenſe of the miſeries of His Proteſtant Subiects in that Kingdome, nor at all to leſsen His Piety and gracious Care for quenching the flames of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>We doe againe affirme unto your Lordſhips the truth of what we ſaid before concerning the Supplies of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and it ſeemes ſtrange, that what hath been lately ſent, ſhould not be looked upon, as a ſupport of the Warre againſt the Rebels,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:158468:72"/> by which onely the Proteſtants were inabled to defend themſelves, and to infeſt their Enemies; Nor can we imagine any other means as a ſupport of that juſt Warre, being moſt aſſured, that if this had not been done, the Rebels must certainly have prevailed, and the remnant of His Majeſties good Subjects of that Kingdomr have periſhed.</p>
                     <p>Your Lordſhips are pleaſed to remember ſome monyes by us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, particularly one hundred Thouſand Pounds, which was raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> all which have been reſatisfied with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; And we muſt as often as you are pleaſed to repeat it, refer your Lordſhips, to our former juſt and clear Anſwers concerning the ſame, and the like for the Forces under the Command of the Lord <hi>Wharton;</hi> And we beleeve what your Lordſhips expreſſe, concerning the Forces brought hither to His Majeſty out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> after the Ceſſation, it being one end for which the Ceſſation was made, that thoſe Forces might be imployed against the two Houſes of Parliament here; And thoſe <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Forces which came over, were not ſent for.</p>
                     <p>We know of no Perſons who have returned into <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the Ceſſation, except ſuch as were Agents for the procuring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and divers principall Rebels who preſumed to addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto His Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and were there countenanced.</p>

                        </hi> Propoſition, (for we do not admit the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> to be ſo) the Commander in cheife of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army, is to receive Inſtructions from him in ſuch manner as we have laid it down, in that anſwer of ours to your Lordſhips paper above mentioned, which will, we hope, ſatisfie your Lordſhips other obiection, that this is not to deliver over the whole
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:158468:73"/> Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> into the hands of His Maieſties Subiects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeeing ſuch of that Nation as are there imployed, are to be ſubordinate to the Committee of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and in caſe of diſagreement, an appeal lies to the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in whom the power of proſecuteing the War is to be ſetled. And we muſt inſiſt to deſire that the Lord Leivtenant, and the Iudges in that Kingdome, may be nominated by the two Houſes of Parliament, who have by ſad experience (to the great coſt of this Kingdom, expence of ſo much treaſure and bloud, the loſse of many thouſand lives there, and almoſt of that whole Kingdom from His Maieſties obedience, and an ineſtimable preiudice to the true Proteſtant Religion,) found the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a bad choyce of perſons for thoſe great places of truſt. Therefore for His Maieſties honour, the good of His ſervice, the great advantage it will be to the reſt of His Maieſties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the great comfort to all good Chriſtians, and even an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice to God himſelf, for the attaining of ſo much good, and the prevention of ſo much evill, they deſire to have the nomination of thoſe great Officers, that by a prudent and carefull Election, they may, by providing for the good of that now miſerable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſcharge their duty to God, the King, and their Country. And certainly if it be neceſſary to reduce that Kingdome, and that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> be a faithfull Councell to His Majeſty, and fit to be truſted with the proſecution of that Warre, (which His Majesty was once pleaſed to put into their hands, and they faithfully diſcharged their parts in it, notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny practices to obſtruct their proceedings, as is ſet forth in ſeverall Declarations of Parliament) then we ſay your Lordſhips need not think it unreaſonable that His Majeſty ſhould engage himſelfe to paſse ſuch Acts as ſhall be preſented to him, for raiſing monyes and other neceſsaries for that Warre, for if the Warre be neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as never War was more) that which is neceſsary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it muſt be had, and the Parliament that doth undertake and manage it, muſt needs know what will be neceſsary, and the People of <hi>England,</hi> who have truſted them with their Purſe, will never begrudge, what they make them lay out upon that occaſion; Nor need His Majesty feare the Parliament will preſſe more upon
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:158468:74"/> the Subject then is fit in proportion to the occaſion; It is true, that heretofore Perſons about His Maieſty have endeavoured and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed too much, in poſseſſing him againſt the Parliament for not giving away the money of the Subiect, when His Maieſty had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it But never yet did His Maieſty reſtraine them from it, and we hope it will not be thought that this is a fit occaſion to begin; We are very glad to find that your Lordſhips are ſo ſenſible in your expreſſions of the Bloud and horror of that Rebellion and it is without all queſtion, in His Majeſties Power to do Juſtice upon it, if your Lordſhips be willing that the Ceſsation, and ali Treaties with thoſe bloudy and unnaturall Rebels be made voyd, and that the proſecution of the Warre be ſetled in the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to be managed by the joynt advice of both Kingdomes, and the King to aſſiſt, and to doe no Act to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or moleſt them therein: This we dare affirme to be more then a probable courſe for the remedying thoſe miſchiefs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the remainder of His Maieſties good Subiects there. We cannot believe your Lordſhips will think it fit, there can be any Agreement of Peace; any respight from hoſtility with ſuch Creatures as are not fit to live, no more then with Wolves or Tygers, or any ravennous Beaſts, deſtroyers of mankind. And we beſeech you doe not think it muſt depend upon the condition of His Maieſties other Kingdomes to revenge or not revenge Gods quarrell upon ſuch perfidious Enemies to the Gospell of Chriſt, who have imbrued their hands in ſo much Proteſtant bloud, but conſider the Ceſſation that is made with them, is for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and rather a protection than a Ceſſation of Acts of hoſtility, as if it had been all of their owne contriving; Armes, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all manner of Commodities may be brought unto them; and they may furniſh themſelves, during this Ceſſation, and be aſſiſted and protected in ſo doing, that afterwards they may the better deſtroy the ſmall remainder of His Maieſties Proteſtant Subjects. We beſeech your Lordſhips in the bowells of Chriſtian charity, and compaſſion to ſo many poor Soules, who muſt periſh, if the strength of that raging Adverſary be not broken, and in the Name of him who is the Prince of Peace, who hates to be at Peace with ſuch ſhedders of Bloud, give not your conſents to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:158468:74"/> of this Ceſſation of Warre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and leſſe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any Peace there, till Juſtice have been fully executed upon the Actors of that accurſed Rebellion. Let not the Judgement of Warre within this Kingdome, which God hath layed upon us for our ſinnes, be encreaſed by ſo great a finne, as any Peace or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them; whatſoever becomes of us, if we muſt periſh, yet let us goe to our graves with that comfort, that we have not made Peace with the Enemies of Chriſt, yea even Enemies of mankind, declared and unreconciled Enemies to our Religion and Nation; Let not our Warre be a hindrance to that Warre, for we are ſure that Peace will be a hindrance to our Peace; We deſire Warre there, as much as we doe Peace here, for both we are willing to lay out our Estates, our Lives, and all that is deare unto us in this World; and we have made Propoſitions unto your Lordſhips for both, if you were pleaſed to agree unto them; We can but look up to God Almighty, beſeech him to oncline your hearts, and caſting our ſelves on him, wait his good time for the returne of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſetling a ſafe and happy Peace here, and giving ſucceſſe to our Endeavours in the proſecution of the Warre of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                     <p>WE cannot expreſſe the great ſadneſſe of our hearts, that <note place="margin">CXCVI.</note> all our earneſt endeavours to give your Lordſhips ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in all particulars of this Treaty, have produced no better effects towards a bleſſed Peace, which His Majeſty, and we who are truſted by him, doe ſo heartily pray for, and that ſo many and great offers made by us to your Lordſhips in the particulars we have treated upon, ſhould not be thought a good progreſſe on our part in the ſaid Treaty, as we find by your Lordſhips laſt paper (to our great griefe) they are not; and therefore that this muſt be the laſt day of the Treaty, we deſire your Lordſhips to conſider, that we being intruſted by His Majeſty to Treat with your Lordſhips for a ſafe &amp; well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Peace, have upon the matter of your Lordſhips Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conſented to ſo many particulars and alterations of very great importance, and that your Lordſhips, who were to Treat with us, have not abated one tittle of the moſt ſevere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of your Propoſitions, ſaving what you were pleaſed the laſt night to propoſe in the poynt of time concerning the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> which though it ſeems to be limited to ſeaven years, in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:158468:79"/> truth leaves it as unlimited as it was before in your Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for at the end of ſeaven years, it muſt not be exerciſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then ſhall be ſetled by His Majeſty and the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament: ſo that all the legall power now in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is taken away, and not reſtored after the ſeaven years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. Neither is there a full conſent to that limiration offered by your Lordſhips the Commiſsioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor have your Lordſhips offered to us any proſpect towards Peace, other then by ſubmitting totally to thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the which if we ſhould doe, we ſhould conſent to ſuch alterations, as by conſtructions and conſequences may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the whole frame of the preſent Government, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civill, in this Kingdom. And though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars propoſed by your Lordſhips, have by debate appeared, not only evidently unreaſonable, but literally conſidered, to comprehend things, to be extended, to powers not intended by your ſelves, yet your Lordſhips have not been pleaſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſtraine or interpret any particular in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then is ſet forth in the ſaid Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>In the matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> we have offered all ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, as we conceive may give ſatisfaction to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that have been, or can be made againſt that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and have given your Lordſhips reaſons, not only why we cannot conſent to your Lordſhips Propoſitions, but that even thoſe Propoſitions, if conſented to, could not be in order to a Reformation, or to the procuring the publique Peace. And we muſt deſire your Lordſhips to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that though you doe not only in your Covenant (which you require may be taken by His Majeſty, and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be taken by all His Subjects) undertake the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in poynt of Government, but even in poynt of Doctrine too, thereby laying an imputation upon the Religion it ſelfe, ſo long profeſſed in this Kingdom with the generall approbation of all reformed Churches; yet your Lordſhips have not given us the leaſt argument, nor ſo much as intimated in your debate, the leaſt Prejudice to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt which we preſume you cannot make any colourable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158468:80"/> objection, nor have you given us the view in particular, of the Government you deſire ſhould be ſubmitted to, in the place of that you propoſe to be aboliſhed; and therefore we propoſe to your Lordſhips, if the alterations propoſed by us, doe not give your Lordſhips ſatisfaction, that ſo great an alteration as the totall abolition of a Government eſtabliſhed by Law, may for the importance of it, and any reformation in Doctrine, for the ſcandall of it, be ſuſpended, till after the disbanding of all Armies, His Maieſty may be preſent with the two Houſes of Parliament, and calling a Nationall Synod, may receive ſuch advice both from the one and the other, as in a matter of ſo high concernment is neceſſary; And we are moſt confident that His Majeſty will then follow the advice which ſhall be given him. And as any Reformation thus regularly and calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, muſt needs prove for the ſingular benefit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Kingdom; ſo we muſt appeale to your Lordſhips, whether the centrary, that is an alteration even to things though in themſelves good, can, by the principles of Chriſtian Religion, be enforced upon the King or Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>In the buſineſſe of the <hi>Militia,</hi> though your Lordſhips doe not deny that the Iealouſies and apprehenſions of danger are mutuall, and that the chiefe end of depoſiting the <hi>Militia</hi> in the hands of certain Perſons, is for ſecurity againſt thoſe Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and poſſible dangers, yet your Lordſhips inſiſt, That all thoſe Perſons to be entruſted, ſhall be nominated by the two Houſes of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and the Eſtares of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the time for that great Generall, and unheard of Truſt, ſhall be in ſuch manner, that though it ſeem to be limited to ſeaven years, yet in truth by declaring, That after thoſe ſcaven years, it ſhall not be otherwiſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then His Maieſty and the two Houſes of Parliament ſhall agree, and His Maieſty may thereby be totally, and for ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of the power of the Sword, without which He can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defend himſelfe againſt Forteigne Invaſions, or Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Inſurrections, or execute His Kingly Office in the behalfe of His Subjects, to whom He is Sworne to give Protection: And to both theſe your Lordſhips adde the introducing a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158468:80"/> Neighbour Nation, governed by diſtinct and different Lawes (though united under one Soveraigne) to a great ſhare in the Government of this Kingdom. In ſtead of conſenting to theſe Changes, we have offered and propoſed to your Lordſhips. That the Perſons to be Truſted with the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may be nominated between us; or if that were refuſed. That an equall number ſhall be named by you, and the other number by His Majeſty, and that halfe the Forts and places of ſtrength within the Kingdom, ſhall be in the cuſtody of thoſe whom you think fit to be truſted therewith, &amp; the other halfe, in ſuch hands as His Majeſty pleaſe to commit the ſame to And all perſons, as well thoſe nominated by your Lordſhips, as by His Majeſty, to take an Oath for the due diſcharge of the ſaid Truſt, which being conſidered as the ſceurity is mutuall, ſo neither part can be ſuppoſed to violate the agreement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very evident inconvenience and danger to that part who ſhall ſo violate it, the whole Kingdom being likely, and indeed obliged to look upon, whoſoever ſhall in the leaſt degree vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this agreement, as the authors of all the miſeries which the Kingdom ſhall thereby ſuffer. And as it is moſt reaſonable, that for this ſecurity, His Majeſty ſhould part with ſo much of his own power, as may make him even unable to break the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, which ſhould be now made by him and on his part, ſo it is moſt neceſſary, that all apprehenſion and danger of ſuch breach being over, that ſoveraign power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould revert into the proper channell, and be, as it hath alwaies been, in His Majeſties proper and peculiar charge: And therefore we have propoſed that the time limited for that truſt, ſhould be for three years, which by the bleſſing of God, will product a perfect underſtanding between His Majeſty and all His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and if there ſhould be any thing elſe neceſſary to be done in this argument, either for power or time, that the ſame be conſidered after the ſettlement of Peace in Parliament; but whatever is now, or hereafter ſhall be thought neceſſary to be done, we deſire may by ſo ſetled, that this Kingdom may depend upon it ſelfe, and not be ſubject to the Lawes or advice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we think ſit, that <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould not receive
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:158468:81"/> rules or advice from this, having offered the like for <hi>Scotland</hi> as for <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>In the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> your Lordſhips propoſe not only, that His Maieſty diſelaime and make voyd the Ceſſation, made by His Royall Authority, and at the deſires of the Lords Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Councell of that Kingdom, and for the preſervation of the remainder of His poore Proteſtant Subiects there, who were in evident danger of deſtruction, both by Famine and the Sword, but alſo to put the whole managery of that Warre and diſpoſall of the Forces within that Kingdom, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Government of that Kingdom, into the hands of the <hi>Scots</hi> Generall, to be managed by the advice of a joynt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Kingdoms, wherein each ſhould have a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voyce; In Anſwer to which, we have acquainted your Lordſhips, with the juſt grounds of His Majeſties proceedings in the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which we are confident, being weighed without preiudice, may ſatisfy all men of His Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Piety and Iuſtice therein; And we are very ready and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, to joyne with your Lordſhips in any courſe which may probably preſerve and reſtore that miſerable Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Having put your Lordſhips in mind of theſe particulars, as they have a generall reference to the publique good of the Kingdomes, we beſeech your Lordſhips to conſider, that we have this great Truſt repoſed in us by His Maieſty, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how farre theſe Propoſitions trench upon His peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Kingly Rights, without any, or any conſiderable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or compenſation.</p>
                     <p>In the buſineſſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> your Lordſhips propoſe the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the His whole Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and Temporalties of Biſhopricks, His firſt Fruits, and Tenths of Biſhops, Deanes and Chapters, inſtead whereof your Lordſhips do not offer to conſtitute the leaſt dependance of the Clergy upon His Maieſty; and for that ſo conſiderable a part of His Revenue, you propoſe only the Biſhops Lands to be ſetled on His Maieſty, (reſerving a power to diſpoſe even thoſe Lands as you ſhall think fit) whereas all the Lands both of Biſhops, Deanes and Chapters (if thoſe Corporations muſt be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:158468:81"/> diſſolved) doe undoubtedly belong to His Majeſty in His own Right.</p>
                     <p>In the buſineſſe of the <hi>Militia;</hi> as it is propoſed, His Majeſty is ſo totally diveſted of the Regall Power of the Sword, that He ſhall be no more able, either to aſſiſt any of His Allies with ayd, though men were willing to engage themſelves volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in that ſervice, or to defend His own Dominions from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or invaſion, and conſequently the whole power of Peace and Warre (the acknowledged and undoubted Right of the Crowne) is taken from Him.</p>
                     <p>In the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the power of nominating His Lievtenant, or Deputy, and other Officers there, of managing, directing, or in the leaſt manner of medling in that Warre, or of making a Peace, is propoſed to be taken, from Him; and to adde to all theſe attempts upon His Kingly Rights, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bereave Him of the Power of a Father, in the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Marriage of His own Children, and of a Maſter, in the rewarding His own Servants; And therefore we referre it to your Lordſhips, whether it be poſſible for us, with a good Conſcience and diſcharge of the Truſt repoſed in us, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Propoſitions made to us by your Lordſhips?

                     <p>In his returne from <hi>Roſſe</hi> (which in the caſe our Forces ſtand, he found ſo difficult to be taken in, as although our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance made a breach in their walls, it was found neceſſary to deſert the Siege) he was encountred by an Army of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, conſiſting of about ſixe thouſand Foot, and ſixe hundred and fifty Horſe well Armed and Horſed, yet it pleaſed God ſo to diſappoint their Councells and ſtrength, as with thoſe ſmall Forces which the Lord Marqueſſe had with him, being of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men about two thouſand five hundred Foot, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe not well armed, and for the moſt part weakly hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and thoſe as well Men as Horſes much weakned by lying in the fields ſeverall nights in much Cold and Raine, and by want of mans-meat and horſe-meat, the Lord Marqueſſe obtained a happy and glorious deliverance and Victory againſt thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, wherein were ſlaine about three hundred of them, and many of their Commanders and others of quality, and divers taken Priſoners, and amongſt thoſe Priſoners Colonell <hi>Cullen</hi> a Native of this City, who being a Colonell in <hi>France,</hi> departed from thence, and came hither to aſſiſt the Rebels, and was Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall of their Army in the Province of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and the Rebels Army were totally Routed and defeated, and their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:158468:100"/> Baggage, and Munition ſeized on by His Majeſties Forces, who lodged that night where they had gained the Victory, and on our ſide about Twenty ſlaine in the fight, and divers wounded.</p>
                     <p>We have great cauſe to praiſe God, for magnifying his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy to his Majeſty, and this his Kingdome ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, and indeed wonderfully in that Victory.</p>
                     <p>However the joy due from us upon ſo happy an occaſion, is we confeſſe mingled with very great diſtraction here in the apprehenſion of our unhappineſſe, to be ſuch, as although the Rebels are not able to overcome His Majeſties Army, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure his other good Subjects here as they deſire, yet both his Army and good Subjects are in danger to be devoured by the wants of needfull Supplies forth of <hi>England,</hi> for as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſignified thither, thoſe Forces were of neceſſity ſent abroad to try what might be done for ſuſteining them in the Country, ſo as to keep them alive untill Supplies ſhould get to us; But that deſigne now failing, thoſe our hopes are converted into aſtoniſhment to behold the unſpeakable miſeries of the Officers &amp; Souldiers for want of all things, and all thoſe wants made the more unſupportable in the want of Food, whileſt this City (being all the help we have) is now too apparently found to be unable to help us, as it hath hitherto done, and divers Commanders and Officers in the Army doe now ſo faire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their ſenſe of their ſufferings, (which indeed are very great and grievous) as they declare that they have little hope to be ſupplyed by the Parliament, and preſſe with ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be permitted to depart the Kingdome, as it will be extream difficult to keep them here.</p>
                     <p>By our Letters of the three and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> we ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thither the unſupportable burthen laid on this City, for Victualling thoſe of the Army left here, when the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe with the Forces he took with him, marched hence, which burden is found every day more heavy then other in regard of the many houſe-keepers thereby dayly breaking up houſe, and ſcattering their Families, leaving ſtill fewer to bear the burden. We alſo by thoſe Letters, and by our Letters of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:158468:100"/> the five and twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> advertiſed thither the high danger this Kingdom would incurre, if the Army ſo ſent abroad, ſhould by any diſtreſſe, or through want be forced back hither againe, before our reliefe of Victualls ſhould arrive forth of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we found that thoſe men were returning back hither, although we were (and are ſtill) full of diſtraction, conſidering the diſmall conſequences threatned thereby in reſpect of our wants, yet we conſulted what we could yet imagine f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſible, that we had not formerly done, to gaine ſome Food for thoſe men, and found, that to ſend them, or others abroad into the Country, we cannot, in regard we are not able to advance Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for procuring the many requiſites incident to ſuch an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. In the end therefore, we were enforced to fixe on our former way, and ſo to ſee who had any thing yet left him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken from him to help us, and although there are but few ſuch, and ſome of them poor Merchants, whom we have now by the Law of neceſſity utterly undone and diſabled, from being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after helpfull to us, in bringing us in Victualls, or other needfull Commodities, yet were we forced to wreſt their Commodities from them, and certainly there are few here of our ſelves, or others, that have not felt their parts in the enforced rigour of our proceedings, towards preſerving the Army, ſo as what with ſuch hard dealing, no leſſe greivous to us to do, then it is heavy to others to ſuffer, and by our diſcending (againſt our hearts) farre below the honour and dignity of that power we repreſent here, under his Royall Majeſtie, we have with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable difficulty prevailed, ſo as to be able to find Bread for the Souldiers for the ſpace of one month.</p>
                     <p>We are now expelling hence all ſtrangers, and muſt inſtantly ſend away for <hi>England,</hi> thouſands of poore diſpoyled Engliſh, whoſe very eating is now unſupportable to this place.</p>
                     <p>And now againe and finally, we earneſtly deſire, (for our confuſions will not now admit the writing of many more Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if any) that His Majeſty and the Engliſh Nation may not ſuffer ſo great, if not irrecoverable prejudice and diſhonour, as muſt unavoydably be the conſequence of our not being relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuddenly, but that yet (although it be even now at the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:158468:101"/> point to be too late) ſupplies of Victualls, and Munition in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be haſtened hither to keep life, untill the reſt may follow, there being no victuall in the ſtore, nor will there be a hundred barrells of powder left in the ſtore, when the out Garriſons (as they muſt be inſtantly) are ſupplyed, and that remainder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſuall neceſſary expenſe, beſides extraordinary accidents, will not laſt above a month, and the reſidue of our proviſions muſt alſo come ſpeedily after, or otherwiſe <hi>England</hi> cannot hope to ſecure <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſecure themſelves againſt <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but in the loſſe of it, muſt look for ſuch enemies from hence, as will perpetually diſturbe the Peace of His Majeſty, &amp; his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and annoy them by Sea, and Land, as we often formerly repreſented thither, which miſcheifes may yet be prevented, if we be yet forthwith enabled from thence with meanes to overcome this Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>We hope that a courſe is taken there for haſtening hither the proviſions of Armes and Munition mentioned in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, ſent with our Letters of the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and the ſix hundred horſes, which we then moved might be ſent hither for recruites, and that the ſeven thouſand eight hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and thirteen pounds three ſhillings for Armes to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>Holland</hi> (beſides thoſe we expect in <hi>London)</hi> hath bin paid to <hi>Anthony Tierens,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or to <hi>Daniell Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and if that Summe had been paid as we at firſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we might well have had thoſe proviſions arrived here by the tenth of <hi>March</hi> as we agreed, however we now deſire that, that Money, if it be not already payd, may be yet paid to M. <hi>Tierens</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or M. <hi>Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> that ſo thoſe proviſions may arrive here ſpeedily, which (conſidering that ſummer is now near at hand) will be very neceſſary, that when our ſupplies of Victualls, Munition, Clothes, Money, and other proviſions ſhall arrive, we may not in the publique ſervice here looſe the benefit and advantage of that ſeaſon.

                     <p>AT our firſt entrance into this unhappy Kingdom, we had no other deſigne, then by Our Swords to aſſert and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the right of His Majeſty, which was here moſt highly abuſed, to redreſſe the wrongs of His poor Subjects, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our own particulars in the proſecution of ſo honeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; And for the firſt of theſe, we do believe they have ſince our comming over ſucceeded pretty well, but for the laſt which concernes our ſelves, that hath fallen out ſo contrary to our expectations, that in ſtead of being rewarded, we have been prejudiced; inſtead of getting a Fortune, we have ſpent part of one; and though we behave ourſelves never ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and performe the Actions of honeſt men, yet we have the reward of Rogues and Rebells, wich is, miſery and want when we come home. Now (my Lords) although we be brought to ſo great an exigence, that we are ready to robbe and ſpoyle one another: yet to prevent ſuch outrages, we thought it better to try all honeſt meanes for our ſubſiſtence, before we take ſuch indirect courſes; Therefore if your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to take us timely into your conſiderations, before our urgent wants makes us deſperate, we will as we have done hitherto, ſerve your Lordſhips readily and faithfully; But if your Lordſhips will not find a way for our preſervations here, we humbly deſire we may have leave to goe where we may have a better being, and if your Lordſhips ſhall refuſe to grant that, we muſt then take leave to have our recourſe to that firſt and prymary Law, which God hath endued all men with, we mean the Law of nature, which teacheth all men to preſerve themſelves.</p>

                     <p>AS ſoon as we your Majeſties Iuſtices, entred into the <note place="margin">X.</note> charge of this government, we took into our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this Board, the ſtate of your Army here, which we find ſuffering under unſpeakable extremities of Want of all things neceſſary to the ſupport of their Perſons, or maintenance of the Warre, here being no Victualls, Cloaths, or other proviſions requiſite towards their ſuſtenance; No Money to provide them of any thing they want; No Armes in Your Majeſties ſtores, to ſupply their many defective Armes; Not above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Barrells of Powder in Your ſtores; No ſtrength of ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Horſes being now left here, and thoſe few that are, their Armes for the moſt part loſt or unſerviceable; No Shipps ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here to guard the Coaſts, and conſequently no ſecurity rendred to any that might (on their private adventures) bring in proviſions of Victualls, or other neceſſaries, towards our ſubſiſtence, and finally, No viſible means by Sea or Land, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to preſerve for You this your Kingdom, and to render deliverance from utter deſtruction, to the remnant of Your good Subjects yet left here.</p>
                     <p>We find that Your Majeſties late Iuſtices, and this Board, have often and fully by very many Letters, advertiſed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>England</hi> of the extremities of Affaires here, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought reliefe with all poſſible importunity, which alſo have been fully repreſented to Your Majeſty, and to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to be made known to Your Majeſty, and although the Winds have of late for many daies (and often formerly) ſtood very faire for acceſſions of ſupply forth of <hi>England</hi> hither, and that we have ſtill with longing expectations, hoped to find proviſions arrive here, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree anſwerable to the neceſſities of Your affaires, yet now (to our unexpreſſible griefe) after full ſix months waiting, and much longer patience and long ſuffering, we find all our great expectations anſwered in a mean and inconſiderable quantity
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:158468:102"/> of proviſions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> threeſcore and fifteen barrells of Butter, and fourteen Tunne of Cheeſe, being but the fourth part of a ſmall Veſſells loading, which was ſent from <hi>London,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here on the fift day of this Month, which is not above ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight daies proviſion for that part of the Army which lies in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the out Garriſons thereof, No mony or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls (other then that inconſiderable proportion of Victuall) having arrived in this place, as ſent from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> or from any other forth of <hi>England</hi> for the uſe of the Army, ſince the beginning of <hi>November</hi> laſt.</p>
                     <p>We have (by the bleſſing of God) been hitherto proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſucceſſefull in Your Majeſties affaires here, and ſhould be ſtill hopefull by the mercy of God, under the Royall Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Your Sacred Majeſty, to vindicate Your Majeſties Honour, and recover your rights here, and take due vengeance on theſe Traitors, for the innocent bloud they have ſpilt, if we might be ſtrengthened and ſupported therein by needfull ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies forth of <hi>England:</hi> but theſe ſupplies having hitherto been expected to come from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (on which if Your Majeſty had not relied, we are aſſured You would in Your High Wiſdom have found out ſome other meanes to preſerve this Your Kingdom) and ſo great and apparent a failer having hapned therein, and all the former and late long continuing Eaſterly Winds, bringing us no other Proviſions, then thoſe few Cheeſes, and Butter; and no advertiſements being brought us of any future ſupply, to be ſo much as in the way hither, whereby there might be any likelyhood, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable means of ſupport for Your Majeſties Army, might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive here in any reaſonable time, before we be totally ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Rebels, and Your Kingdom by them wreſted from you.

For the Ceſſation already made, it is apparent it was the onely viſible meanes, whereby the Kingdome was preſerved, the poore Proteſtants there being in danger inevitably to have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, either by Famine, for want of Food, or by the Rebells, for want of Ammunition, there being not above Forty Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells of Powder there, as appears by the Letters of the Lords Iuſtices and Councell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> mentioned by Our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and no ſupplies of Victualls or Money ſent in ſix months time before thoſe Letters (although Our Ships were then taken away from Vs, and all the Forces at Sea belonging to this Kingdom, were under their command:) Neither could the not making voyd, or declaring againſt that Ceſſation, have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Peace upon this Treaty, if it had been intended really on their part, it being to expire in <hi>March,</hi> and ſo before the Treaty could probably have been perfected, and there being no further Peace or Ceſſation made in <hi>Ireland;</hi> And therefore

                     <p>They ſay, <hi>They have mentioned particulars of proviſions for</hi> Ireland, (beſides thoſe few clothes taken neere <hi>Coventry,</hi> which being formerly anſwered by Our Commiſſioners, they do not againe urge) <hi>aſſerted to be ſeiſed, not without Our owne knowledge and directions, as they were informed.</hi> This they had formerly alledged and our Commiſſioners had anſwered (as we do now) that they have inſtanced no particulars at all of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch proviſions ſeiſed. And whereas they ſay, that Out <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to ſeiſe ſome proviſions</hi> (which Our Commiſſioners alleadged in our greateſt wants, we forbore to take, though they lay in Magazines, within Our owne Quarters, but took order to ſend away into <hi>Ireland,) was no excuſe for ſeiſing others,</hi> they miſapply that to be an excuſe, which was alleadged as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that We ſeiſed none, ſince we might in Our great want have ſeiſed thoſe if we had been minded to have ſeiſed any.</p>
                     <p>They ſay again, <hi>the ſervice of that Kingdom, was much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by denying the Lord</hi> Wharton's <hi>Commiſſion, of which they have not received ſatisfaction.</hi> To this it hath been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that thoſe Forces were raiſed for him, before any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion demanded from us, and that the Commiſſion for him propoſed to us, was, to have been independant of the Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that Kingdom; Cauſes (though not ſatisfactory to them) yet ſufficient in themſelves to juſtifie Our re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But beſides theſe, it is apparent the Army which was brought down againſt Vs, was their raiſing, that the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> was one of the moſt active in it, and We had cauſe to be confident (nor did he faile us therein) that what Forces he ſhould raiſe for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he would imploy againſt us in <hi>England,</hi> neither did that ſervice depend upon the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> other able Officers were appointed over thoſe Forces, whom (if they had as much affected that ſervice as the Perſon of the Lord <hi>Wharton)</hi> they might have truſted with the Tranſport of them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where others of more experience and fitter for Conduct, then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:158468:114"/> the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> might have taken the charge of them. They ſay further, That it was <hi>one end for which the Ceſſation was made, that the Forces might be brought hither to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, out of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and imployed againſt the two Houſes.</hi> The bleeding neceſſities of the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> there (which have been mentioned, and whereof they cannot but be convinced) will beſt ſpeak the cauſe of that Ceſſation, and the fight of thoſe Souldiers halfe ſtarved, when they came over, having neither Clothes to their Backs, nor ſo much as Shooes to their Feet, nor any pay to provide either, will witneſſe the neceſſity of bringing them over, when there was no ſubſiſtance for them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor uſe for them there, during the Ceſſation; And for making uſe of them here, how can they quarrell at Our imploying Our owne <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers, who ſhould otherwiſe have disbanded, when they make uſe of an Army of <hi>Scots</hi> againſt Vs.</p>
                     <p>They have bin told that they brought over out of <hi>Ireland</hi> the Earle of <hi>Leven,</hi> their Generall, and diverſe <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Officers, (which they deny not;) and that before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces brought over, they attempted the bringing once the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as likewiſe diverſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Kingdom; to which all the anſwer given is, <hi>that the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Forces, which came over, were not ſent for.</hi> Which as it denies not what is objected, ſo neither can it excuſe their not ſending them back to the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imploying them here in an unnaturall Rebellion againſt Vs.</p>
                     <p>But whatſoever their owne acts or failings have bin in this buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; though apparently the neceſſities, which cauſed the Ceſſation, were occaſioned by the two Houſes, yet rather then they ſhall be guilty of the blame and neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Our people muſt be made to beleive, that either there were no ſuch neceſſities, or when that is ſo apparent, then that thoſe neceſſities were deſigned and contrived by a Popiſh and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall party, prevalent with Vs, and the ſupplyes denyed and ſtopped by Our Selfe, and ſo that it is reaſonable for them to preſſe and inſiſt, (as they do with much fervour) in their laſt Paper concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon their demands for the ſetling of the proſecution of the War in themſelves, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

And laſtly, that if the diſtractions continued here, the Forces and Wealth of this Kingdome would be ſo imployed at home, that the proſecution of that

                     <p>For the power given to Our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Subjects in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Our Commiſſioners urged, that Generall <hi>Leven</hi> being to Command all the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Committee of <hi>Scotland</hi> having a Negative voyce upon difference of opinion, that Warre muſt either ſtand ſtill to the ruine of Our Subjects there, or be carryed as the Earle of <hi>Leven</hi> pleaſed, whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was not bounded by any refeerence to Vs, or Our Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> no nor to the Houſes of <hi>England,</hi> and though it had bin anſwered, that in caſes of diſagreement betwixt the Committee, the two Houſes might proſecute the War, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Treaty of the ſixt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the Ordinance of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> yet by referring to that Ordinance, (which is deſired to be enacted) and by that Ordinance the power being thereby put into the Earle of <hi>Leven,</hi> and that Committee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of the two Houſes, it was apparent the Earle of <hi>Leven</hi> would not be bound to obſerve the directions of the Houſes of <hi>England</hi> by themſelves.</p>

                     <p>They tell us, <hi>the Parliament of England is a faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to us, and that we have truſted them with the proſecution of that Warre, and they faithfully diſcharged their parts in it,</hi> We wiſh, though We are willing to be ſilent in it, that yet the ruines and deſolations of this Kingdom would not ſpeak to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity what Councellors thoſe are, who have diveſted Vs of Our Revenue, Armes, Ships, Power, and even the ſecurity of Our perſon, who have Armed Our Subjects here, who have brought in the <hi>Scots</hi> into this Kingdom, to the tearing up the bowels of it, who have infamouſly libelled againſt Vs and Our Conſort, who have threatned to depoſe Vs, and impeached Her of Treaſon, and who thoſe are, who have denied Peace to this miſerable Kingdom, unleſſe We would conſent to their unreaſonable deſtructive Propoſitions, overturning the whole frame of government, both in Church and State.
